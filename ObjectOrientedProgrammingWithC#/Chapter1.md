# Introduction

Do you know how many programming languages are there in the world! I myself doesn't have any answer to this question. But there are many i can say that for sure. C# is one of them, but surly one of the most popular one in current time. When C# started its journey, it was mainly competing another giant programming language called Java. Both are very similar in looks and structure. C# was developed by Microsoft and still maintained by Microsoft. In the year 2000, microsoft lanuched C# programming language under the Common Language Infrustucture. It is an object oriented programming language. Few of its characteristics are its strong typing, declarative, object oriented, functional and generic.

Anders Hejlsberg was the lead of the C# language development team. While developing the where influenced by many languages like C, C++, Java, Pascal, VB. The main motive was to create an excellent language which will have all the benefits of the mentioned languages and avoid the demerits they have. But defenitly its not possible to make a perfect programming language. But now at the year of 2018, where the language is around 18 years old, is one of the finest and most popular progrmaming languages.
