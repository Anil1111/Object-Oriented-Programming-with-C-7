## What is OOP

"Object Oriented Programming" - this is something special. Our book title has this 3 words in it. If you search in the internet for books on Object Oriented Programming, you might get hundreds of books on this topic. Why is that? What is this actually? Is it a programming language? Is it a technology? A tool? What is it? In this chapter, we will try to understand what is Object Oriented Programming.

As always before proceeding, lets try to analyze the meaning of these words in English. So "Object Oriented Programming" has 3 different words in it. The first word is "Object", according to dictionary an Object is something material which can be seen or touched. So in easy words we can say, something which exists in real world physically is an object. Something which is virtual is not categorized as object.

The second word in the list is "Oriented", which means something that has influence on some event, or something like a guideline. For example, in English we can say "We are oriented towards the building", which means that we are keeping the building in our centre and standing somewhere near to it.

The third word is "Programming", i think i don't need to give any explanation for this word as you are reading this book, you surly have some exposure to programming.

Now if we think about the whole sentence "Object Oriented Programming", i am sure we can feel the sentence. We understand what does it mean. It means that we will do programming keeping objects in the center of our thinking. While we will design a software or just write a piece of code, we will organize our thought or code in objects.

Yes, as objects is the centre or key feature of object oriented programming. We will discuss about objects in a great detail in this chapter.

No lets go back to our first question, what is this "Object Oriented Programming"? Its not a tool, its not a programming language. Its just a concept! It's concept or an idea or a way of work. You can also say, its kind of a rule-set for programming.

In object oriented programming, you try to think your software components into small objects and create relationship with them to connect the application and solve problem. Except object oriented programming there are also other concepts in the programming world, such as Procedural programming. If you have ever written code in C programming language, then you have followed the procedural way. But languages like C#, Java, C++ are developed keeping Object Oriented Programming in mind. So these languages are also called, Object oriented programming language.

Object oriented programming is such a common term now a days in the software industry that we made of short form for it, which is OOP. OOP stands for Object Oriented Programming.

Now let's see how this concept or OOP works. What are the building blocks of this practice.

## Class in OOP

Classes are one of the most important concepts of OOP. Classes are the basis of objects. A class is a blueprint of an object. In OOP you derive objects from classes. Now lets analyze what is a class actually.

A class is template, its a skeleton which tells what properties it has and what things it can do. In normal circumstances A class itself can't do anything, it just helps creating objects from it.

For example, Human can be catogorized as a class. As when we say Human, we don't mean any particular person, but we mean a kind of creature which has hands, feet, mouth etc and it can walk, talk, eat, think and so many other things. So by te properties and behaviour we are cetogizing or classinfying sometihng. And this classsificaion is named as class in programming.

So we know human is a class and for simplycity lets just say, it has 3 properties.

1. Hight
2. Weight
3. Age

And also it can do 3 things:

1. Walk
2. Talk
3. Eat

So, if we want to have any human object in our software. We can create an object from this class and use it. When we wll create the object it would be a specific person. For example, myslef. I am Raihan and i am a human. I have all the properties and behaviours.
